**Running the Project**

**Prerequisites:**

1.  Install Node.js and npm from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

<!-- end list -->

```bash
npm i node
```

2.  Install the Expo CLI globally:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

**Cloning the Repository:**

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
git clone https://github.com/romelx23/manage-money
```

Replace `https://github.com/romelx23/manage-money` with the URL of your repository.

**Installing Dependencies:**

1.  Navigate to the project directory:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
cd manage-money
```

2.  Install the project's dependencies:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
npm install
```

**Starting the Development Server:**

1.  Start the Expo development server:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
expo start
```

2.  Follow the instructions in the terminal to connect your physical device or emulator.

**Additional Commands:**

- **Building the app:**

<!-- end list -->

```bash
expo build:android
```

or

```bash
expo build:ios
```

Replace `android` or `ios` with the desired platform.

- **Running tests:**
  If you have unit or integration tests, you can run them using your testing framework's specific commands (e.g., `jest`, `react-testing-library`).

**Explanation of Commands:**

- `expo start`: Starts a development server that allows you to see changes to your app in real-time on a physical device or emulator.
- `expo build`: Builds a version of your app that you can distribute to app stores.
- `npm install`: Installs all dependencies for your project that are listed in the `package.json` file.

**Customization:**

- You can add more details about project setup, such as environment variables or specific requirements.
- Include screenshots to showcase your app's user interface.
- Explain the organization of your files and folders.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Specify Node.js and npm versions if your project requires specific versions.
- Mention any additional tools used in the project (linters, code formatters) and provide instructions for setting them up.
- Provide instructions for database setup if your app uses a database.

**Example with More Details:**

**Note:** This example is not included in markdown format as it's meant to provide additional guidance for customization.

I hope this revised version offers clarity, conciseness, and valuable information for running your React Native Expo TypeScript project\!
